== Paragraphs

.Optional Title
Just text. Line breaks
ignored.

Another paragraph.

 A literal paragraph is indented

To pass inline text through unchanged to HTML, wrap with three `+`:

....
+++<div id=x>+++
....

=== Assign id and CSS class(es) (a.k.a. roles) to inline text

Roles = CSS classes can be assigned similarly as ID, see "Links and anchors" below. Ex.: `+[.class.another]#some text#`.

== Text Formatting

|===
| *bold* | `+*bold*+`
| _italic_ | `+_italic_+`
| *_both_* | `+*_both_*+`
| `monospace` | `+++`monospace`+++`
| `+li**t**eral+` | `+li**t**eral+` - add `+` to suppress formatting etc.
| `*_works in code_*` | `+++`*_works..._*`+++`
| **b**ol__d__ c``od``e | double to stop mid-word: `+++**b**ol__d__ c``od``e+++`
| #highlight# | `+#highlight#+`
| [.underline]#underline# | `+[.underline]#underline#+`
| [.line-through]#line-through# | `+[.line-through]#line-through#+`
| [.my-class]#txt# | assign arbitrary css class: `+[.my-class]#txt#+`
| ^super^script | `+^super^script+`
| ~sub~script | `+~sub~script+`
| "`double curved quotes`" | `+"`double curved quotes`"+`
| '`single curved quotes`' | `+'`single curved quotes`'+`
| apostrophes`' vs x' | `+apostrophes`' vs x'+`

== Blocks and admonitions

=== Admonitions

NOTE: An admonition *paragraph* draws attention to auxiliary information.

[NOTE]
====
* An admonition *block* may contain complex content.
====

All admonitions: NOTE, TIP, IMPORTANT, WARNING, CAUTION .

=== Blocks

.General structure of a block:
```
.Optional title
[optional attributes]
<separator (2 or 4 characters)>
<content>
<separator>
```

|===
| block type | separator, attributes, comments

| source code | `----`; attributes: `[source,ruby]`
| source code (markdown) 
| +++```&lt;language&gt; ... ```+++
| sidebar | `+++****+++`
| example | `====`; expandable^1^: `[%collapsible]`, closable: `[%collapsible%open]`
| quote   | `+++____+++`; attributes: `[quote, Author, Source]`^2^
| quote, alternative | "Text in quotes", on a new line `-- Author, Source`
| open^1^    | `--` An anonymous container; can masquerade as any other by naming it: `+[source\|...]+`
| passthrough | four `+`, pass content unchanged; e.g. to include HTML  
|===

1. The expandable example block and open block may contain other blocks
2. Wrap the quote source in `'` to be able to include adoc links etc.

General block attributes: link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/attributes/ids/#anchor[`id`] (or `+#+`), link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/attributes/role/[`role`] (or `.`) = css class. Example of both using the shorthand form: `+[quote#roads.movie.class2, Dr. Emmett Brown]+`.

== Lists

.List basics
* Level 1
** Level 2, ... up to 5
   *** Lists can be indented. Leading whitespace is not significant.
   . Nested level 1 order list
   .. order list 2nd level
+
[example]
--
To include complex content, unindent it and
put the list continuation sign `+` on the line between it and the list item
--
   .. but a literal paragraph does not require a list continuation:

   $ echo "it works"

   .. end

== Links and anchors

=== Anchors

*Block or a section* heading: in the attribute list include `[id=yourid]` or the shorthand form `+[#yourid]+` (as first).

*Inline*, on quoted text using either formatting marks such as `*` or `#`: `+[#inline_target]#targeted# txt+`. Or just insert an empty anchor: `+[[empty-anchor]]not inside+`.

Anchors can be used anywhere where macro substitution applies.

*Link to it* to it via `+<<myid>>+`, which will use the target text as the label, or `+<<myid,custom label>>+`.

=== Links

TODO

== Images

== Tables

== Extra

* comments

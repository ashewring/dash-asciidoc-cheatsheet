== Structure

=== Document header

TODO

=== Attributes

TODO

=== Section titles

....
= h1
== h2
=== h3
etc.
....

== Paragraphs

.Optional Title
Just text. Line breaks
ignored.

Another paragraph.

 A literal paragraph is indented

To pass through unchanged to HTML, wrap with three `+`:

....
+++<div id=x>+++
....

=== Assign id and CSS class(es) (a.k.a. roles) to inline text

Roles = CSS classes can be assigned similarly as ID, see "Links and anchors" below - only using `[.class.another]` instead of `[#id]`.

== Text Formatting

|===
| *bold* | `+*bold*+`
| _italic_ | `+_italic_+`
| *_both_* | `+*_both_*+`
| `monospace` | `+++`monospace`+++`
| `+li**t**eral+` | `+li**t**eral+` - add `+` to suppress formatting etc.
| `*_works in code_*` | `+++`*_works..._*`+++`
| **b**ol__d__ c``od``e | double to stop mid-word: `+++**b**ol__d__ c``od``e+++`
| #highlight# | `+#highlight#+`
| [.underline]#underline# | `+[.underline]#underline#+`
| [.line-through]#line-through# | `+[.line-through]#line-through#+`
| [.my-class]#txt# | assign arbitrary css class: `+[.my-class]#txt#+`
| ^super^script | `+^super^script+`
| ~sub~script | `+~sub~script+`
| "`double curved quotes`" | `+"`double curved quotes`"+`
| '`single curved quotes`' | `+'`single curved quotes`'+`
| apostrophes`' vs x' | `+apostrophes`' vs x'+`

== Blocks and admonitions

=== Admonitions

NOTE: An admonition *paragraph* draws attention to auxiliary information.

[NOTE]
====
* An admonition *block* may contain complex content.

* IMPORTANT 
* WARNING 
* CAUTION 

=== Blocks

.General structure of a block:
```
.Optional title
[optional attributes]
<separator (2 or 4 characters)>
<content>
<separator>
```

|===
| source code | `----`; attributes: `[source,ruby]`
| source code (markdown) 
| +++```&lt;language&gt; ... ```+++
| sidebar | `+++****+++`
| example | `====`; expandable^2^: `[%collapsible]`, closable: `[%collapsible%open]`
| quote   | `+++____+++`; attributes: `[quote, Author, Source]`^1^
| quote, alternative | "Text in quotes", on a new line `-- Author, Source`
| open^2^    | `--` An anonymous container; can masquerade as any other by naming it: `+[source\|...]+`
| passthrough | four `+`, pass content unchanged; e.g. to include HTML  
|===

1. Wrap the quote source in `'` to be able to include adoc links etc.
2. The expandable example block and open block may contain other blocks

General block attributes: link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/attributes/ids/#anchor[`id`] (or `#`), link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/attributes/role/[`role`] (or `.`) = css class. Example of both using the shorthand form: `+[quote#roads.movie.class2, Dr. Emmett Brown]+`.

=== Source code listing

== Lists

.List basics
* Level 1
** Level 2, ... up to 5
   *** Lists can be indented. Leading whitespace is not significant.
   . Nested level 1 order list
   .. order list 2nd level
+
[example]
--
To include complex content, unindent it and
put the list continuation sign `+` on the line between it and the list item
--
   .. but a literal paragraph does not require a list continuation:

   $ echo "it works"

   .. end

.Checklist

== Links and anchors

=== Anchors

*Block or a section* heading: in the attribute list include `[id=yourid]` or the shorthand form `+[#yourid]+`

*Inline*, on quoted text using either formatting marks such as `*` or `#`: `+[#inline_target]#targeted# txt+`. Or just insert an empty anchor: `+[[empty-anchor]]not inside+`.

Anchors can be used anywhere where macro substitution applies.

.Anchors
[example]
--
[#inline_bold]*free the world*

[#inline_nonspecific]#free the world#

[#id-via-attribute]
=== Title

...
--

Via `+[#myid]+` at the beginning of an attribute list or `+[[another-id]]+`.

Link to it via `+<<myid>>+` or `+<<myid,custom label>>+`. The text will be taken from the target:

[[myid]]target text.
